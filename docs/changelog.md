# Changelog

This package uses a variant of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) that
makes additional promises during the initial development (major version 0):
whenever breaking changes to the public API are published, the first non-zero
version number will increase. For example, code that uses version 0.6.0 if this
package will also work with version 0.6.1, but may break with version 0.7.0.

## v0.1.0

Initial version. Code has been extracted from
[cernml-coi](https://gitlab.cern.ch/be-op-ml-optimization/cernml-coi/) and
[cernml-coi-funcs](https://gitlab.cern.ch/be-op-ml-optimization/cernml-coi-funcs/).
Documentation has been adjusted.
