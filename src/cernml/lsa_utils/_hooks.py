    This is the class that you should subclass to implement your own
    :ref:`guide/lsa_utils:Global Trim Request Hooks`.

    This class implements the installation/uninstallation logic for
    hooks:

        >>> hooks = Hooks()
        >>> hooks.install_globally()
        >>> get_current_hooks() is hooks
        True
        >>> hooks.uninstall_globally()

        False

    Instead of calling `~Hooks.install_globally()` and
    `~Hooks.uninstall_globally()` manually, it is usually easier to use
    the hooks as a :term:`context manager` in a :keyword:`with`
    statement:

        >>> with hooks:
        ...     assert get_current_hooks() is hooks

    This class also provides base implementations for the abstract
    methods defined by `AbstractHooks`; these simply forward the method
    call to whatever hook was installed before this one.

    Calling the hook methods while the hook is not installed raises a
    `RuntimeError`:

        >>> hooks.trim_description(None)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
